venn-cljs
=========

A quick demonstration of ClojureScript and D3 working together to produce an interactive SVG Venn diagram with fully independent sections. The code is a simplified version of that used on http://www.sparrho.com to help users pick the scientific fields theyâ€™re interested in. 

Just run `lein cljsbuild once` from the root folder to compile the project, and open `index.html` in your browser to take a look at the results.
